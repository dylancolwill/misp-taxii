### **add\_objects**

**File Location:** `endpoints/objects.py`  
**Endpoint:**  
`GET /taxii2/{api_root}/collections/{collection_uuid}/objects/`

*The goal of this endpoint is to add a STIX object to a specific TAXII collection.*

**Description**  
Allows clients to publish new STIX objects into a TAXII Collection. All submitted objects must be wrapped in a TAXII envelope. The server validates authentication, permissions, and payload format before processing. If the collectionâ€™s `can_write` property is set to false for the client, the request is rejected.

If accepted, the endpoint returns a status resource describing whether the submitted objects were successfully processed, are still pending, or failed. Duplicate objects are not permitted.

**Example Request**  
```

Authorization: <misp-api-key>
Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1

#### Logic

| Step |
|------|
| 1. Get all MISP tags, convert each tag name to uuid and compare with collection_uuid to find MISP tag.<br>2. Parse the TAXII envelope and validate the structure of the contained STIX objects.<br>3. Push to the collection, if duplicate will deny.<br>4. Apply any client filters not included in MISP to that list, including finding the specific object via UUID.<br>5. Generate a status resource with successful, pending, and failed submissions.<br>6. Return response and set TAXII response
