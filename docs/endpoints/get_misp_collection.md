*File Location***:** endpoints/collections.py

*Endpoint***:**   
GET /taxii2/{api\_root}/collections/{collection\_uuid}/

*The goal of this endpoint is to retrieve information about a specific TAXII collection.*

*Each MISP tag is treated as a TAXII collection object.*

*Description*  
This endpoint provides general information about a single TAXII Collection. Used by clients to understand the collectionâ€™s name, description, and user access permissions before requesting or pushing data.

The endpoint queries MISP for all tags, matches the provided collection\_uuid against each converted tag ID, and returns the matching tag.

*Example Request*
