### **get\_api\_root**

*File Location***:** endpoints/root.py

*Endpoint***:**   
GET /taxii2/{api\_root}/collections/{collection\_uuid}/objects/{object\_uuid}/versions/

*The goal of this endpoint is to provide metadata about the TAXII server, including available API Roots. This allows clients to discover what data and services the server exposes.*

*Description*  
This endpoint returns general information about the TAXII server, including its title, description, and the API Roots. Clients can use this as the entry point to explore the serverâ€™s available data.

The API roots are dynamically generated from the server configuration. Access is permission based, clients will only see API Roots if they have access.

MISP does not have native support for roots equivalent, instead associated with different MISP servers. The MISP IP is defined through API roots and is used in each request. 

*Example Request*  
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/taxii2/

Authorization: \<misp-api-key\>  
Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1  
Content-Type: application/taxii+json;version=2.1
